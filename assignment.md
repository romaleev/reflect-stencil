# Team Reflect Assignment

## Introduction

We enjoyed the interview with you and would love to see some of your
skills in practise. The assignment is used to see if your a good match
for the team and the type of the work we do.

**Good luck!**


## Description

For this assignment, we would like to see a form component developed, 
containing an input component that consists of multiple input fields
(e.g. postal code, license plate, money with cents etc). The following
functionalities should be implemented:

- the form should be unaware of the component's multiple separate input 
  fields, the input should be accessible as a single, combined value.
- the form should only be submittable when the combined value passes a 
  self-chosen pattern / validation.
- basic input behaviour / state should apply (e.g. disabled, required).

## Goal

The goal of this assignment is to get a general understanding of your
approach on component development and an idea of your creativity and
passion. We would like to see your current skillset, keep it simple and
show what you've got.


## Time

There is no expectation for this assignment to take multiple days. It 
should not take more than 4-6 hours of your time.


## Requirements

- Usage of StencilJS for component development.
- Apply proper component logic and behaviour, follow best practises.
- No usage of other frameworks or libraries.
- Pay attention to presentation / styling (styled form and fields).
- Minimal Unit / E2E test coverage (coverage with at least one test 
  where applicable).
- Handle unexected user input.


## Guidelines

Remember this component could be implemented in a corporate environment,
used throughout the organisation, so:

- Write readable, consistent code.
- Write basic documentation.
- If you skipped some parts to devote more time to a certain item, 
  please describe this in the readme so we know why you skipped
- Commit early, write proper commit messages. Resulting in clean history
- Try to give an estimation on worked hours / time logging.


## Getting started

We advise the use of StencilJS to get a quick dev setup. For more info
check the [StencilJS Docs](https://stenciljs.com/docs/getting-started).
